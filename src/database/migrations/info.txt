Folder /migrations

We have one existing database migration, 20241025023422-create-user.js. 

This file is generated by running npm run migration — name “create-user” and after generating the file. 
Don’t remove the generated date because sequelize uses the date to sort the migration file. 
Don’t forget to add “create” before the table name because currently sequelize uses it to clarify whether 
the file in the migrations folder is a migration file or not. For example, npm run migration—name “create-product”.
